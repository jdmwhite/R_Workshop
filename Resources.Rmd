### Where to ask questions?
* The best place to find answers to your R problems is the internet. However, finding the most appropriate answer quickly is also a skill and will improve as your understanding of R grows. 
* So start with Google. Craft your questions to only have a few key words that may help refine your search. For example: "select columns in R" or "select columns in R dplyr" if you want something `tidyverse` related.
* Many of your Google queries may take you to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). This is a community full of R users who are asking and answering all things R related. There is a very good change that your query has already been answered here.
