# Background

In this workshop, we will cover four primary topics to get you started with R/RStudio. 

On day 1, we will cover:

1. Installing R/RStudio and setting up your workspace
2. Basics of data cleaning, manipulation & plotting

On day 2, we will cover: 

3. Version control & collaborating
4. Reporting R outputs

# 1. Installing R/RStudio and setting up my workspace

```{r out.width='20%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudio_logo.png")
```

## Installing R/RStudio

### How to install R & RStudio?

### What is RStudio?

## Setting up your workspace

### My workspace

### My file structure

### File naming conventions

# 2. Basics of data cleaning, manipulation & plotting

```{r out.width='20%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyverse_hex.png")
```

## What is the tidyverse?

### dplyr

### ggplot2

### Why should I use tidyverse over Base R?

# 3. Version Control & Collaborating

```{r out.width='20%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/GitHub_logo.png")
```

### What is Git/Github?

"Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git has been re-purposed by the data science community... to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports" - Jenny Bryan, [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)

Git makes it easy to back-up your projects, communicate with colleagues and simultaneously work on the same files.

[Github](https://github.com/) is a hosting service, which provides an online space for your work. It is a hosting & sharing platform for your projects, which can far exceed the uses of Google Drive or DropBox. 

### Why should I use Github?

You may be asking whether this is an essential tool for you to learn as a beginner in R? Well, it is always easier to create good habits when you are starting than further down the line. So my answer is yes.

### Installation
