This short workshop will introduce you to the basics of R and go over some fundamentals that you may have previously missed. 

It is aimed at R beginners, though many lessons will likely be useful to those who have been using R for several years with bad ingrained practices. 

## We will cover four topics:

1. Data wrangling

2. Data visualisation

3. Data analysis

4. Github & Rmarkdown

## Getting started

### R Studio run locally on your computer

* Step 1: Download R: https://cran.r-project.org/ (select the correct operating system for your computer)

* Step 2: Download R Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (select the correct operating system for your computer)

Once you have download and installed both, all you need is to open R Studio. The next step is to go to https://github.com/jdmwhite/R_workshop, click **"Code"** in the top right corner and the click **"Download ZIP"**. Unzip this file, by double-clicking on it, and then open the `R_workshop.Rproj` file. Make sure to open the file with the `.Rproj` file extension. This will automatically open R Studio and begin your session. Once it has opened, open the **scripts** folder and then click on any `.R` file. You can now run the code, either using (CONTROL + ENTER/CMD + ENTER) or click the **Run** button in the top middle of your screen.

### R Studio Cloud

Go to [R Studio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). Either **Sign Up** or as you have already run a practical here before, **Log In** to your account. 

Once you have logged in, click on **New Project** in the top right corner. Select **New Project from Git Repository**. Copy and paste this link into the open space: https://github.com/jdmwhite/R_workshop

Wait for the project to deploy (this may take a couple of minutes). Once it has opened, open the **scripts** folder and then click on any `.R` file to explore the code. 

You can now run the code, either using (CONTROL + ENTER/CMD + ENTER) or click the **Run** button in the top middle of your screen.

Make sure to **LOG OUT** of your R Studio Cloud session when you are finished using the platform. You are granted 25 free hours per month. But these hours will be depleted quickly if you don't log out!
