# SAEON Graduate Student Network Workshop

## Basics of R

This short workshop will introduce you to the basics of R and go over some fundamentals that you may have previously missed. 

It is aimed at R beginners, though many lessons will likely be useful to those who have been using R for several years with bad ingrained practices. 

It consists of four lectures or themes:
1. Installing R and setting up your workspace
2. Version control
3. Reporting R workflows
4. Basics of data cleaning & manipulation
